Q1. Given two integer variables a and b, and a boolean variable flag. The task is to check the status and return accordingly.
Return True for the following cases:
Either a or b (not both) is non-negative and the flag is false.
Both a and b are negative and the flag is true.
Otherwise, return False.
class Solution:
    def checkStatus(self, a, b, flag):
        if ((a >= 0 and b < 0) and flag is False):
            return True
        if ((a < 0 and b >= 0) and flag is False):
            return True
        if ((a < 0 and b < 0) and flag is True):
            return True
        return False
Q2. Given a positive integer x. Your task is to check, if it is even or odd (Any number that gives zero as remainder when divided by 2 is an even number).
Note: Return "Even" if the number is even; otherwise, return "Odd".
def checkOddEven(x):
    if (x % 2 == 0):
        return "Even"
    else:
        return "Odd"
Q3. You are familiar with basics of input/output and many other useful things in Python. This module is all about conditional statements like if, elif, else; for, while, etc.
In Python, any conditional statement ends with ':' (proper indentation must be followed while working through loops).
There are two friends, John and Smith, and the parameters j_angry and s_angry to indicate if each is angry. You are in trouble if both of them are angry or no one of them is angry.
Now, complete the function which returns true if you are in trouble, else return false
def friends_in_trouble(j_angry, s_angry):
    if (j_angry==True and s_angry ==True):
        return True
    if (j_angry is False and s_angry is False):
        return True
        
    return False
Q4. You are given a number  and you have to print your answer according to the following:
If the number is divisible by 3, you print "Fizz" (without quotes)
If the number is divisible by 5, you print "Buzz" (without quotes)
If the number is divisible by both 3 and 5, you print "FizzBuzz" (without quotes)
In any other case, you print the number itself
def fizzBuzz(number):
    if number % 3 == 0 and number % 5 == 0:
        print("FizzBuzz")
    elif number % 3==0:
        print("Fizz")
    elif number % 5==0:
        print("Buzz")
    else:
        print(number)
Q5. You are given a number n. The number n can be negative or positive. If n is negative, print numbers from n to 0 by adding 1 to n in the neg function. 
If positive, print numbers from n-1 to 0 by subtracting 1 from n in the pos function.
def pos(n):
    ## Write the code
    for i in range(n-1, -1, -1):
        print(i, end=" ")
    
def neg(n):
    ##Write the code
    for i in range(n, 1):
        print(i, end=" ")
Q6. Given a positive integer x, the task is to print the numbers from 1 to x in the order as 12, 22, 32, 42, 52, ... (in increasing order).
def printIncreasingPower(x):
    i = 1
    while i*i <= x:
        print (i * i, end=" ")
        i += 1
Q7. Given a positive integer x, the task is to print the numbers from 1 to x in the order as 12, 22, 32, 42, 52, ... (in increasing order).
def printIncreasingPower(x):
    i = 1
    while i*i <= x:
        print (i * i, end=" ")
        i += 1
Q8. Writing for loop in Python is a tad different from C++ and Java counterparts. In this question, we'll learn to print table by using the for loop.
You are given a number N, you need to print its multiplication table.
def multiplicationTable(N):
    for i in range(1, 11):
        print(N * i, end=" ")
Q9. You are given a number a and you have to print your answer according to the following:
If the number is divisible by 3, you print "Fizz" (without quotes)
If the number is divisible by 5, you print "Buzz" (without quotes)
If the number is divisible by both 3 and 5, you print "FizzBuzz" (without quotes)
In any other case, you print the number itself
a = int(input())
if a % 3 == 0 and a % 5 == 0:
    print("FizzBuzz")
elif a % 3 == 0:
    print("Fizz")
elif a % 5 == 0:
    print("Buzz")
else:
    print(a)
Q10. Given a number x, the task is to print the numbers from x to 0 in decreasing order in a single line.
def printInDecreasing(x):
    while (x >= 0):
        print(x, end=" ")
        x -= 1
Q11. You are given a string s, you need to print its characters at even indices(index starts at 0).
def stringJumper(s):
    for i in range(0,len(s),2):
        print(s[i], end="")
Q12. Given a tuple arr , print "True" if all elements of tuple are different otherwise print "False".
arr = tuple(map(int, input().split()))
a = len(set(arr))==len(arr)
print(a)
Q13. Given a string s, you need to reverse it.
def reverseString(s):
    a = (s[::-1])
    return a
Q14. Given name of a person, the task is to welcome the person by printing the name with "Welcome". If name is "John", you should print "Welcome John".
def welcomeAboard(name):
    print(f"Welcome",name)
Q15. In this question, we'll take a look at inbuilt string methods like title(), swapcase(), find(), strip().
You'll be given a string str and x, you'll perform various operations on them.
def trim(str):
    a = str.strip()
    return a
def exists(str, x):
     b = str.find(x)
     return b
def titleIt(str):
    c = str.title()
    return c
def casesSwap(str):
    d = str.swapcase()
    return d
Q16.  check if the given string S meets the specified conditions of starting and ending with 'gfg'.
# Function to check if string
# starts and ends with 'gfg'
def gfg(S):
    b = S.lower()
    if b.startswith ("gfg") and b.endswith ("gfg"):
        print("Yes")
    else:
        print("No")
Q17. Given a tuple arr with distinct elements and an integer x, find the index position of x. Assume to have x in the tuple always. Print the index (0-based).
arr = tuple(map(int, input().split()))
x = int(input())
print(arr.index(x))
